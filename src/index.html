                The ensō is a circular symbol often referred to as “The Zen Circle“.
                The word itself simply translates to “circle” in Japanese; however,
                it embodies one of the defining aspects of Zen Buddhism, no-mind.
                A state of no-mind is where a person is free from thoughts and emotions
                while being completely present in the now. It is believed that while in
                this state of total presence, true creativity can arise. Creating the zen
                circle is often done standing, so as to utilize the entire body for the expression
                of the brush stroke. Some Zen Buddhists “believe that the character of the artist
                is fully exposed in how she or he draws an ensō. Only a person who is mentally and
                spiritually complete can draw a true ensō. Some artists will practice drawing an ensō
                daily, as a kind of Spiritual Practice.”
